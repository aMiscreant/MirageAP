# MirageAP
Evil Twin Wi-Fi pentesting tool designed for the ESP8266 platform. It performs targeted deauthentication attacks on a selected Wi-Fi network and simultaneously creates a fake access point (AP) that mimics the target's SSID. The fake AP serves a convincing router firmware update captive portal to capture credentials or perform social engineering.
